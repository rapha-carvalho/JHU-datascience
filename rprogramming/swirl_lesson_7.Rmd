# Subsetting Vectors

The way you tell R that you want to select some particular elements (i.e. a 'subset') from a vector is by placing an
'index vector' in square brackets immediately following the name of the vector. For a simple example, try x[1:10] to view the first ten elements of x.

```{r 1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
x[1:10]
```
